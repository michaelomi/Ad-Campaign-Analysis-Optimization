## 🚀 Recommendations

### 📈 Campaign Strategy Improvements

- **Increase Ad Spend on High-Performing Keywords 💸**  
  Focus more budget on:
  - **High Waisted Black Jeans** (ROAS 32.26)
  - **Black Leather Trousers** (ROAS 20.77)  
  Consider slightly increasing spend on **High Waisted Jeans** ($164.52 in sales) while monitoring its higher ad cost on sales (13.87%).

- **Pause Underperforming Keywords ⛔**  
  Cease or scale back spend on:
  - *Womens High Waisted Jeans*
  - *Skinny Jeans Women High Waisted*
  - *Leather Trousers*  
  These keywords have failed to generate sales despite high impressions and ad spend.

- **Bid Adjustments and Match Types 🎯**  
  - Use **exact match** for high-intent keywords like *"leather trousers women"* and *"jeans for women uk"* to improve CTR.
  - Use **phrase match** for broader but relevant terms like *"high waisted jeans"* to balance reach and control.
  - **Increase bids by 10–15%** on top performers to boost visibility and placement.

- **Optimize Ad Creatives ✍️**  
  The low overall CTR (1.37%) suggests ad messaging or visuals may not resonate.
  - Test new ad copy emphasizing unique features (e.g., *“Perfect Fit High Waisted Jeans”*).
  - Use high-quality product images with clear lifestyle context.

---

### 🛍️ Listing, Image & Sizing Improvements

- **Address Sizing Issues 📏**  
  - Add a detailed sizing chart (waist, hips, inseam).
  - Include customer feedback like *“runs small, consider sizing up”*.
  - Show diverse model body types in product photos to improve expectation accuracy.

- **Improve Product Descriptions 📝**  
  - For returns citing *style* and *quality*, expand product details: fabric type, stretch level, fit (slim/tapered), etc.
  - Include multiple high-resolution images, showing close-ups of stitching, material texture, and fit on models.

- **Review or Pause Problematic SKUs 🛑**  
  - Investigate SKU `114_BLK_FBA_M` (33.60% returns) for sizing or quality defects.
  - Monitor SKU `161_FBA_M/38` and others above 15% return rate and update listings as needed.

---

## 📉 Conclusion

The Sponsored Products campaign has a solid foundation with a strong ROAS of **5.81** and high-performing keywords like *“high waisted black jeans”* and *“black leather trousers.”* However, improvements are needed in the following areas:

- Increase investment in proven, high-ROAS keywords.
- Eliminate wasted spend on underperforming search terms.
- Refine match types and bidding strategies to boost CTR.
- Address major return causes—primarily sizing accuracy—to reduce return-related losses.

By executing these changes and continuously monitoring performance, the campaign can achieve greater efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction.
